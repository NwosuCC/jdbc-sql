Java & Threads
Threads are essentially subprocesses1: informally, we can think of them as tasks that run "simultaneously" within a program. For example, a web server application may have a number of threads running at a given time, each responding to a different web page request. A graphics rendering application may have different threads running, each rendering a different portion of an image. A strategy game might have multiple threads running, each exploring different potential moves for an AI player to make.

When multiple threads are in process, the computer's operating system and processor(s) between them determine how to actually distribute the threads among the available CPU resources. If precisely two threads are running and there are two CPU cores available, then in principle, the threads can literally run simultaneously, one on each core. But the reality is usually muchg more complex:

there will usually be a large number of threads competing for a small number of shared resources (CPU cores, memory, even specific components of a given CPU core...);
at a given moment in time, a thread that is "running" may actually not be able to progress because it is waiting for some resource to become available (e.g. data from a particular source, a lock on a particular file etc).
This complex process of allocating threads to available resources is generally termed thread scheduling.

Allocating threads to available CPU resources is complex in part because of the complexity of modern computer architectures, which are increasingly designed around allowing mutliple processes to run in parallel. But the converse is therefore true: if your program doesn't make use of threads in some way, it is likely that you will not be able to make maximum use of the available computing resources.



Java threading APIs
Like modern programming languages generally, Java has a range of APIs available for managing threads within your application:

The Thread class, along with associated interfaces and classes such as Runnable, provide the lowest level API that the programmer generally needs to deal with. This API provides simple thread methods allowing you to deal with threads in broad terms: starting them; defining the task they will run; telling the current thread to "sleep"; interrupting a thread; setting a thread's priority etc. This API does not define thread tasks in terms of logical concepts such as jobs, queues, time limits etc.
The Java executor framework allows threads and their tasks to be defined in more "logical", higher-level terms (e.g. "tasks" are "scheduled" or added to queues).
The Java Stream API provides a means to "process a collection of objects in parallel".
Getting started with the Java threading API
It's easier to illustrate what a thread is by diving straight in and seeing some code. We're going to write a program that "splits itself" into two simultaneous tasks. One task is to print Hello, world! every second. The other task is to print Goodbye, cruel world! every two seconds. OK, it's a silly example.

For them to run simultaneously, each of these two tasks will run in a separate thread. To define a "task", we create an instance of Runnable. Then we will wrap each of these Runnables around a Thread object.

Runnable
A Runnable object defines an actual task that is to be executed. It doesn't define how it is to be executed (serial, two at a time, three at a time etc), but just what. We can define a Runnable as follows:

Runnable r = new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    ... code to be executed ...
  }
};
Runnable is actually an interface, with the single run() method that we must provide. In our case, we want the Runnable.run() methods of our two tasks to print a message periodically. So here is what the code could look like:

Runnable r1 = new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    try {
      while (true) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        Thread.sleep(1000L);
      }
    } catch (InterruptedException iex) {}
  }
};
Runnable r2 = new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    try {
      while (true) {
        System.out.println("Goodbye, " +
		"cruel world!");
        Thread.sleep(2000L);
      }
    } catch (InterruptedException iex) {}
  }
};
For now, we'll gloss over a couple of issues, such as how the task ever stops. As you've probably gathered, the Thread.sleep() method essentially "pauses" for the given number of milliseconds, but could get "interrupted", hence the need to catch InterruptedException. We'll come back to this in more detail in the section on Thread interruption and InterruptedException. The most important point for now is that with the Runnable() interface, we're just defining what the two tasks are. We haven't actually set them running yet. And that's where the Thread class comes in...

Thread
A Java Thread object wraps around an actual thread of execution. It effectively defines how the task is to be executed— namely, at the same time as other threads2. To run the above two tasks simultaneously, we create a Thread object for each Runnable, then call the start() method on each Thread:

Thread thr1 = new Thread(r1);
Thread thr2 = new Thread(r2);
thr1.start();
thr2.start();
When we call start(), a new thread is spawned, which will begin executing the task that was assigned to the Thread object at some time in the near future. Meanwhile, control returns to the caller of start(), and we can start the second thread. Once that starts, we'll actually have at least three threads now running in parallel: the two we've just started, plus the "main" thread from which we created and started the two others. (In reality, the JVM will tend to have a few extra threads running for "housekeeping" tasks such as garbage collection, although they're essentially outside of our program's control.)

Next: threading topics
On the next page, we look at the following Java threading topics:

Constructing a thread: different ways for constructing a task and/or thread, and which to use when;
thread control methods provided by the Thread class;
thread interruption: a mechanism for "waking a thread up" early from a blocking call;
stopping a thread: looking at how to stop a thread in Java;
Threads with Swing: how to correctly uses threads in a GUI-enabled application, including a look at the key method SwingUtilities.invokeLater();
How threads work: more details about what a thread actually is, how threads are implemented by the OS, and how thread scheduling affects Java, looking at issues such as limits on thread control methods, how to avoid thread overhead and lock contention;
Thread scheduling: a look at the component of the OS which manages "juggling" threads among the available CPUs;
coordinating threads with a CountDownLatch;
Thread safety: an overview of data synchronization and visibility issues that occur in multithreaded programming;
Thread pools in Java: introducing the ThreadPoolExecutor class and associated utility classes and methods;
we describe the problem of deadlock, where two threads cannot advance as they each are holding resources the other needs to proceed; and of course, we look at how to prevent deadlock;
thread coordination with CyclicBarrier, incuding the example of a parallal sort algorithm.
1. A process is essentially a "heavy" unit of multitasking: as an approximation, think of it as an "application" (though it can include 'background' or 'system' processes such a your battery monitor or file indexer). A thread, on the other hand, is a more "lightweight" unit. Different processes generally have certain resources allocated independently of one another (such as address space, file handle allocations), whereas a threads generally share the resources of their parent process.
2. We'll see later that the Thread object also encapsulates other details, such as a thread's priority.

Docker: Mounts denied. The paths … are not shared from OS X and are not known to Docker
Ask Question

The command docker run -v /var/folders/zz/... produces the following error.

docker: Error response from daemon: Mounts denied:
The paths /var/folders/zz/... and /var/folders/zz/...
are not shared from OS X and are not known to Docker.
You can configure shared paths from Docker -> Preferences... -> File Sharing.
When I do open File Sharing, I see that /private is listed already.

If I attempt to add /var/folder/, it resolves to /private/var/folders, which is a subset of /private and hence the addition is rejected.

To summarize, it looks to me like the directory /var/folders/.. is shared by OS X as a subdirectory of /private and hence must be known to Docker. Any help on resolving this would be appreciated.

As an experiment, I replaced the /private in File Sharing with /private/var/folders and restarted the docker but the result did not change.

Just for a more complete reference, this is the .sh script, which runs this python script, which in turn runs the docker command.

Did you try -v /private/var/folders/zz/... ? – Dan Lowe Jul 15 '17 at 20:34

@DanLowe: I had not, because the code went like WORKING_DIR="$(mktemp -d) and, -v ${WORKING_DIR}. But hacking that to WORKING_DIR="/private"$(mktemp -d), seems to resolve the issue. Thank you so much :) – Aayush Jul 15 '17 at 21:05

I'll post an answer explaining why it worked when I get a few minutes – Dan Lowe Jul 15 '17 at 21:07

That'd be great, thanks again. – Aayush Jul 15 '17 at 21:20

Docker for Mac volume mounts behave differently than the base Docker system. This is mostly because Docker tries to comply with Apple's filesystem sandbox guidelines.

As shown in Docker's preferences, only certain paths are exported by macOS.

/Users
/Volumes
/tmp
/private
File Sharing preference panel

/var in macOS is a symbolic link into /private. That is also true for /tmp:

$ ls -ld /tmp /var
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Jan 26 16:18 /tmp -> private/tmp
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 Jan 26 16:18 /var -> private/var
Why is /tmp listed in the sharing panel, but /var is not (even though both are a part of /private)? Docker for Mac's documentation about filesystem namespaces explains:

By default, you can share files in /Users/, /Volumes/, /private/, and /tmp directly. To add or remove directory trees that are exported to Docker, use the File sharing tab in Docker preferences whale menu -> Preferences -> File sharing. (See Preferences.)

All other paths used in -v bind mounts are sourced from the Moby Linux VM running the Docker containers, so arguments such as -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock should work as expected. If a macOS path is not shared and does not exist in the VM, an attempt to bind mount it will fail rather than create it in the VM. Paths that already exist in the VM and contain files are reserved by Docker and cannot be exported from macOS.

Note that /var/run is specifically mentioned here as a place that would be mounted from the Linux VM, instead of from macOS.

When you ask for a volume mount, macOS filesystem exports are checked first. If there is no match there, the Linux VM where Docker is running is checked next. If neither of them have the path you requested, then the mount fails.

In your case, /var is not exported by macOS. /var exists in the Linux VM, but /var/folders does not. Therefore, the path is not available, and the mount fails.

If you change the path to /private/var, then it will succeed, because macOS exports the entire /private filesystem tree for mounting.

In order to make things more portable, you may want to test which platform you are currently running on, and if it's macOS, prefix the mount path with /private.

@SamuelMéndez Just the first one. The format is mac-path:container-path, and /private would only exist on the Mac side of it. – Dan Lowe Sep 7 '17 at 13:33

I facing similar issue can anyone help me to resolve ("b'Mounts denied: \r\nThe path /etc/localtime\r\nis not shared from OS X and is not known to Docker.\r\nYou can configure shared paths from Docker -> Preferences... -> File Sharing.\r\nSee docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces for more info.\r\n.'") tried adding /etc via Docker -> Preferences... -> File Sharing it says /etc is reserved for mac os any solutions guys? – Sandish Kumar H N Feb 13 '18 at 5:43

@DanLowe Thanks for the response. If I try to add /private/etc/localtime is throwing "The export path /private/etc/localtime overlaps with the export path /private." I tired adding "/etc/localtime" but got new error it says "APIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error ("error while creating mount source path '/etc/localtime': mkdir /etc/localtime: file exists")" Any Idea?? – Sandish Kumar H N Feb 13 '18 at 15:40

Let us continue this discussion in chat. – Sandish Kumar H N Feb 13 '18 at 16:56

@DanLowe Thank you for your kind answer. I understand you. When we develop on Mac OS, deploy on Ubuntu. We use docker-compose to volume /etc/localtime. Are we gonna check the system and set different path? Like /private/etc/localtime for mac os, /etc/localtime for ubuntu. How to tell the system info in Docker-compose.yml? Thank you! – hzwzw Sep 1 '18 at 17:58

As an example, using Portainer, this command works for me:

docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 9000:9000 \
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 -v /var:/data portainer/portainer --no-auth
But, if I vary the -v /var:/data at all, it won't work. I think (but not sure) that its because Docker is trying to do a mkdir. So, if I try to mount -v /var/whatever:/data, mkdir fails because not enough permission, and it doesn't work.

I have 2 Mac's (High Sierra) and I tried it on both. Same problem. Also, I tried using Docker Beta channel. I think I understand Dan Lowe's answer: I'll update this answer if that works for me.
